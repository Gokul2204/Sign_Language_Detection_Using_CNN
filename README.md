# Sign_Language_Detection_Using_CNN
Implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras for recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) gestures. Trained on the Sign Language MNIST dataset, this project aims to facilitate communication for the deaf or hard of hearing through real-time interpretation of hand gestures.
